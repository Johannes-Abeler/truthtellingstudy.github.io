The decision whether to lie or to tell the truth is at the heart of many everyday activities, for example, when a self-employed shopkeeper reports her income to the tax authorities or when XXX more everyday example. It is very difficult to find out how much people lie in such situations, since the truth is not known. Recently, cleverly-designed experiments have been used to find out. This website documents what people do in one particularly clever experiment, introduced by Fischbacher & Föllmi-Heusi (2013): subjects privately roll a die or flip a coin. They then report the outcome and receive a monetary payoff equal to their report. 
While no individual report can be identified as truthful or not, the researcher can judge the reports of a group of subjects. There is no possibility of detecting a false report and XXX only subject’s conscience is holding 

We combine data from XXX treatments that use such a setup involving more than XXX subjects across XXX countries. These treatments were conducted by many different researchers. We find the following: 

Finding 1: Subjects forgo a large part of the potential gains from lying.



In Figure 1 each circle shows the average report of one treatment. If a circle is further up, it signifies that the subjects in this treatment reported higher outcomes. The size of the circle indicates the number of subjects in that treatment. You can get more information about the treatments by hovering over the graph or by clicking on a circle. You can also restrict the figure to only certain kinds of treatments, for example, only treatments from your country.
